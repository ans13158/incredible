                                        <p>The most beautiful of all Himalayan flowers, the blue Primula can be seen blooming in thousands in the valley. The best time to see the valley in full bloom is from mid July to mid August.To reach the valley one has to trek from Govind Ghat, on the route to Hemkund Sahib, upto Ghangaria, 12 kms ahead.Few furlongs ahead of Ghangaria the trek route to the valley takes a detour towards left. The valley is about 5 kms from Ghangaria. The high altitude serine lake, known as Hemkund ( 4329 mts.) lies in heavenly environs. A steep trek from Ghangharia leads one to this spot in about four to six hours. It is an important pilgrimage for both Hindus and Sikhs, as well as for people from other faiths. There is a Sikh Gurudwara and a Lakshman temple built on the bank of the lake. Encircled by seven snow clad peaks and their associated glaciers, it reflects its surroundings enchantingly on its crystal clear serene waters. The glaciers from Hathi Parvat and Saptrishi peaks feed the lake and a small stream called Himganga flows out of this lake. As alluded to, in the holy Granth Sahib, Guru Govind Singh, the tenth Guru of the Sikh faith had meditated on the bank of this lake in one of his earlier births. It is widely believed among Sikhs that Guru Govind Singh introduced the features now universally associated with Sikhism. On 15th April 1699, he started the new brotherhood called the Khalsa (meaning the pure, from the Persian word 'Khales') an inner core of the faithful, accepted by baptism (amrit). The five K's' date from this period: kesh (uncut hair) kangha (comb), kirpan (dagger or short sword), kara (steel bangle), and kachh (boxer shorts).</p>

According to mythological legends, the eye of Goddess Sati fell at this spot while Lord Shiva was carrying Her mortal remains to Mount Kailash. This is how She began to be worshipped as 'Naina', which means eye on translation. The Nanda Devi Temple (also known as Naina devi Temple) is one of the most important places of religious significance in Nainital. It is also the venue of the Nanda Devi Mahotsav, which is a grand religious celebration organised to honour Ma Nanda and Sunanda â€“ two local goddesses. Nanda Devi temple is quite famous not just in Kumauni people but whole of Uttarakhand. There are numerous temples of Nanda Devi in Kumaon hills and the hills of far-western Nepal dedicated to goddess Parvati as the daughter of Himalayas. The temple is most famous for the Nanda Devi Fair that is hosted every year in the month of September. Tourists from different parts of the country travel to Almora to participate in this 5 day festival, which is accompanied with drum beats and energetic dances. Two images of Nanda and Sunanda are made with banana trunk.</p>
                                        <p>It is believed that the Naini Lake is one of the 64 Shakti Peeths, or religious sites where parts of the charred body of Sati (Parvati) fell on earth while being carried by Lord Shiva. The spot where Sati's eyes (or Nain) fell, came to be called Nain-tal or lake of the eye. The goddess Shakti is worshiped at the Naina Devi Temple on the north shore of the present day lake.</p>
