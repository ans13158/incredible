                                        <p>Situated alongside the northern shore of the Naini Lake, this temple is dedicated to Goddess Sati and is counted amongst the 64 Shakti Peethas devoted to Her. According to mythological legends, the eye of Goddess Sati fell at this spot while Lord Shiva was carrying Her mortal remains to Mount Kailash. This is how She began to be worshipped as 'Naina', which means eye on translation. The Nanda Devi Temple (also known as Naina devi Temple) is one of the most important places of religious significance in Nainital. It is also the venue of the Nanda Devi Mahotsav, which is a grand religious celebration organised to honour Ma Nanda and Sunanda – two local goddesses. Nanda Devi temple is quite famous not just in Kumauni people but whole of Uttarakhand. There are numerous temples of Nanda Devi in Kumaon hills and the hills of far-western Nepal dedicated to goddess Parvati as the daughter of Himalayas. The temple is most famous for the Nanda Devi Fair that is hosted every year in the month of September. Tourists from different parts of the country travel to Almora to participate in this 5 day festival, which is accompanied with drum beats and energetic dances. Two images of Nanda and Sunanda are made with banana trunk.</p>
                                        <p>It is believed that the Naini Lake is one of the 64 Shakti Peeths, or religious sites where parts of the charred body of Sati (Parvati) fell on earth while being carried by Lord Shiva. The spot where Sati's eyes (or Nain) fell, came to be called Nain-tal or lake of the eye. The goddess Shakti is worshiped at the Naina Devi Temple on the north shore of the present day lake.</p>

	                                        <p>According to legend, at some time in the Satya Yuga, Daksha performed a yagna (named Vrihaspati) with a desire of taking revenge on Lord Shiva. Daksha was angry because his daughter Sati had married the 'yogi' God Shiva against his wishes. Daksha invited all the deities to the yagna except for Shiva and Sati. The fact that she was not invited did not deter Sati from attending the yagna. She had expressed her desire to attend to Shiva who had tried his best to dissuade her from going. Shiva eventually allowed her to go escorted by his ganas (followers). But Sati, being an uninvited guest, was not given any respect. Furthermore, Daksha insulted Shiva. Sati was unable to bear her father's insults toward her husband, so she committed suicide by jumping into the yajna fire. Enraged at the insult and the injury, Shiva destroyed Daksha's sacrifice, cut off Daksha's head, and replaced it with that of a goat as he restored him to life. Still crazed with grief, he picked up the remains of Sati's body, and danced the dance of destruction through the Universe. The other gods intervened to stop this dance, and the Vishnu's disk, or Sudarshana Chakra, cut through the corpse of Sati. The various parts of the body fell at several spots all through the Indian subcontinent and formed sites which are known as Shakti Peethas today. In Purnagiri the Naabhi (Naval) part of Sati fell and people come here to worship the devi here. From Purnagiri, also known as Punyagiri, the river Kali descends into the plains and is known as Sharda. For visiting this shrine, from Tanakpur, there is a motorable road till the Thulligad which is located at about 14 Kms from Tanankpur.</p>
